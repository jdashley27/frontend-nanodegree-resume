#Resume

##Description
For this project, I found the use of JavaScript to inject data from JSON objects to be fun, engaging, and challenging. I've converted all of the data into their respective objects (bio, education, projects, and work). All of the data is appended to the DOM via functions, which can be called and utilized in any order.

I've updated the CSS on the page to add diversity in it's design, as-well-as a menu navigation that is fixed to the top. The page isn't very responsive, as I didn't change the framework and wanted to focus primarily on working with the JSON objects.

These projects have been great, and I'm looking forward to starting on Project 3....
